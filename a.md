Here is some plain text.

Next, let's write some pseudo code. Note that you don't _have_ to specify a language if using plain backticks.

```
object <- [some kind of calculation]
```

If you set `eval = FALSE` you can get the highlighted background

```{r, eval = TRUE}
object <- [some kind of calculation]
Note that this; is not valid R code
```

You may find it interesting that your example works just fine for me.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
loop through each species
    loop through each measurement of the current species
    ...
etc.
```
